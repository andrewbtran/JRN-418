Complaints about Bistricky's behavior date at least to 1974, when parents of CYO teens wrote to archbishop that Bistricky encouraged ""mooning"" and ""streaking, "" appeared nude in front of the teens on a CYO trip and took a nude photo of a boy. Bistricky was reprimanded and sent to counseling. In 1997 archdiocese received allegations Bistricky abused boy over three-year period in early 1970s when boy 13 to 16 yrs-old. Accuser said he was told Bistricky would have no contact with children, but in 2002 learned Bistricky was helping out at a local parish. Sklba was notified and immediately restricted Bistricky from active ministry. Allegations deemed credible but no prosecution due to SOL. In 2005 accused of abuse of 11-year-old boy in 1968. Claim filed after 2011 archdiocesan bankruptcy of abuse including rape of altar boy in early 1970s.
